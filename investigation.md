# Agent Antonova Investigation Log

## Problem Statement
The autonomous agent is running and moving tasks in the GitHub Projects board but not creating pull requests.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: GraphQL Error (RESOLVED)
- **Problem**: `GraphQL: Could not resolve to a node with the global id of '43'`
- **Root Cause**: The agent was using issue numbers instead of project item IDs when calling GitHub Projects v2 API
- **Solution**: Added `findProjectItemIdByIssueNumber()` method to lookup correct project item IDs
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue #2: Claude Code SDK Execution Failure (IDENTIFIED)
- **Problem**: `Claude Code process exited with code 1`
- **Root Cause**: The Claude Code SDK is failing to execute properly
- **Details**:
  - SDK call with `permissionMode: 'acceptAll'` fails
  - Direct CLI calls with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` also fail/hang
  - Local `.claude/settings.local.json` permission configuration may be interfering
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Updated permissions to allow all (`"allow": ["*"]`)
  - Switched from SDK to direct CLI calls
  - Added `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
- **Status**: ❌ NOT RESOLVED

### Issue #3: Issues Not Found in Project Board (IDENTIFIED)
- **Problem**: Agent reports "No ready issues found" despite having ready issues
- **Root Cause**: Issues exist in the repository but are not added to the project board, AND their status field is not set to "Ready"
- **Details**:
  - `gh issue list` shows 5 ready issues (#44, #43, #42, #41, #40)
  - Project board only had 3 items initially, now has 6 items
  - Issues added to project board: #44, #43, #42, #41, #40, #7
  - **KEY INSIGHT**: Project board status field is separate from GitHub issue labels
  - The "ready" label on issues ≠ "Ready" status in project board
- **Solution**: Need to set project board status field to "Ready" for each issue
- **Status**: ❌ NOT RESOLVED (issues added to board but status not set)

## Current Status

### Agent Execution Flow
1. ✅ Agent starts and initializes
2. ✅ Loads configuration from `.antonova/config.json`
3. ✅ Connects to GitHub Projects API
4. ❌ Fails to find ready issues (despite issues being added to board)
5. ❌ Claude Code execution fails when issues are found

### Key Findings
- The agent successfully resolves the GraphQL error for status updates
- The Claude Code SDK integration is broken
- Issues need to be properly added to the project board with correct status
- The agent will only create PRs after successful Claude Code execution

## Next Steps
1. Debug why ready issues are not being found in the project board
2. Fix the Claude Code execution issue
3. Test the complete flow: issue detection → execution → PR creation

## Technical Details

### Configuration
- Repository: `nuvemlabs/agent.antonova`
- Project: #1 "Antonova Agent Backlog"
- Project ID: `PVT_kwHODJE8Ss4A9RzZ`
- Adapter: `github-projects`

### Issues Available
- #44: "add a html page with the birds of New Zealand" (priority-high, ready)
- #43: "Build container documentation" (priority-low, ready, feature, devcontainer)
- #42: "Create container health checks" (priority-low, ready, feature, devcontainer)
- #41: "Add development tools" (priority-low, ready, feature, devcontainer)
- #40: "Optimize devcontainer for agent" (priority-medium, ready, enhancement, devcontainer)

### Error Messages
- `Claude Code process exited with code 1` - SDK execution failure
- `No ready issues found` - Project board issue detection failure
- `GraphQL: Could not resolve to a node with the global id of '43'` - RESOLVED

## Code Changes Made
1. **GitHub Projects Adapter** (`src/adapters/github-projects-adapter.js`):
   - Added `findProjectItemIdByIssueNumber()` method
   - Updated `updateIssueStatus()` to use correct project item IDs
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. **Autonomous Agent** (`src/autonomous-agent.js`):
   - Switched from Claude Code SDK to direct CLI calls
   - Added `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag
   - Updated imports to include `spawn`

3. **Claude Settings** (`.claude/settings.local.json`):
   - Changed permissions from specific allowlist to `"allow": ["*"]`
